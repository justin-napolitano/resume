:ref:`The Turkish Kurdish Event Database <turkish_kurdish>`
------------------------------------------------------------

.. topic:: Overview

    The Turkish Kurdish Event Database is a catalogue of the human rights abuses, terrorist activity, and military operations that have taken place in Anatolia since the beginning of the Kurdish Conflict in 1984.

    The finished project was presented at the Hague at the Peace Science Conference.  

    My role in the project is documented below:


:ref:`Experimental Design and Research Coordination <event_query_procedure>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. card:: 

    * I created the research methodology that enabled a team of research assistants to code data points.
    * I ensured that the data collection, aggregation, and integration procedures met standards defined in the literature to retain rigor for analysis.
    * I developed the training tools and manuals for research assitants.

:ref:`Database Designer <Database Schema>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. card:: 

    * I designed a third normal database to maintain logical consistancy and variable independence of data points.
    * I refined the data to easily be recoded into a graph database.
    * I maintained the NoSQL database with Python scripts that automated the data integration procedures for a team of 5 data coders.

:ref:`Lead Analyst <data_page>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. card:: 

    * I wrote Python Scripts to export data from the database into Pandas Dataframes in order to perform analysis.
    * I used mathplotlib to chart results. 
    * I summarized the results into accompanying papers and presentations that were later presented among peers at the Peace Science Conference in Switzerland. 

Project Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. card:: 

    * I led a team of 5 research assistants.
    * I trained the team of research assistants to code a large event dataset according to the standards of the research methodology.

Author
^^^^^^^^
.. card:: 

    * I wrote an accompanying paper that analyzed the findings from the dataset.

Emotional Decision Making 
----------------------------------
.. topic:: Overview

    Emotional Decision is a paper written by Dr. Tom Dolan of the University of Central Florida. 

    My role in the project is documented below.  

Data Coding 
^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. card:: 

    * I was intially hired to work as a data coder for the project that encoded the perceived emotional score of the transcripts of a Uk Parliamentarion debate regarding the prospect of invading Iraq.

Data Integrator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. card:: 

    * I proposed methods to integrate the data among three coders in a way that ensured reliable scoring.
    * I integrated all of the data into a NoSql Database.
    * I exported the data into excel files that were shared among the coders.
    
Data Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. card:: 
    
    * I wrote python scripts that identified missing values and other patterns that required review. 
    * I maintained version history of the data to compare changes
