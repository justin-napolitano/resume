## Political Science Can be A Predictive and Explanatory Science



Political scientists further extended the ideas of the {ref}`political realists <realist_argument>`. 

Their arguments are founded upon the foundation of political science as argued by Somit and Tanenhaus ({cite}`somit1967development`, 177-178):

1. Political Science can ultimately become a science capable of prediction and explanation.
2. Political science should concern itself primarily, if not exclusively, with phenomena which can actually be observed. 
3. Data should be quantified and “findings” based upon quantifiable data.
4. Research should be theory oriented and theory directed

## Justices Create the Law




(llewellyn)=
### Karl Llewellyn
Karl Llewellyn introduced the first principles of legal realism, the “conception of law in flux, of moving law, and of judicial creation of law {cite}`llewellyn1931some`."   The central premise is that the static conception of the law as “a complete and autonomous system of logically consistent principles, concepts and rules” is inconsistent with the reality of jurisprudence [^who].  For instance, as Frank puts it, “the law is uncertain, indefinite, subject to incalculable changes” and above all “vague and variable ({cite}`frank2017law`, 5-7)"  For legal realists, then judicial opinions purporting legal rules merely rationalize decisions; rules cannot be the cause of them.  

(pritchett)=
### C. Herman Pritchet
C. Herman Pritchet's the Roosevelt Court ({cite}`pritchett1969roosevelt`, xii-xiii). suports Llewellyn's theory.  Pritchet's *The Roosevelt Court* systematically analyzes ideological configurations from the Court’s nonunanimous decisions between 1937 and 1947 finding that the “the politics and values of the Roosevelt Court were predominantly motivated by the preferences of the Justices.”  An idea that is currently heterodox among the majority of U.S. Representives and Senetatori [^public-aside], [^kavanaugh].

## Structural Systems Permit Judicial Independence 





Structural Systems permit judicial independence as supported by the sections below.

### Freedom from Electoral Pressures Liberates Justices from Public Opinion

(giles-and-walker)=
#### Giles and Walker 1975

The central idea of this section is proposeed by Giles and Walker.  They argue that because justices are not elected they are not subject to electoral pressures.  As such, they seem not to be affected by matters of public opinions.  Justices, therefore can inject their policy preferences into their jurisprudence. {cite}`giles1975judicial`

```{todo}
This spection can and will be greatly expanded.  Citing the federalist papers with a ml algorithm would be interesting..... 
```


(segal-and-spaeth-2002)=
#### Segal and Spaeth 2002

Because of the Supreme Court’s rules and structures, in part due to those of the American political system in general, life tenured justices may reach decisions based on their personal policy preferences.  They may further their policy objectives because “they lack electoral or political accountability, have no ambition for higher office, and comprise a court of last resort that controls its own caseload ({cite}`segal2002supreme`, 92)."  As Segal argues, these factors permit “rationally sincere behavior ({cite}`segal2002supreme`, 91).”    

Similarly, “justices are virtually immune to political accountability({cite}`segal2002supreme`, 94). The Congress has ability to Impeach Supreme Court Justices, this has only happened once and the vote failed.  The appellate Jurisdiction of the court depends upon Congressional statute.  However, the Congress fails to exert this power to the utmost extent {cite}`expartemccardle`.  The most likely reason for this is the fact the long-term consequences to the Congress’ political capital far outweighs any short-term policy gains. Notwithstanding there is evidence that Roberts in 1937 and Harlan in 1959, reversed politically unpopular decision as result of Congressional threats. 

This does not by rule restrict the Congress from passing new legislation in response to the verdicts of the court.  There is the possibility of new statute, or even the passage of a new amendment.  For example, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act  {cite}`rfra1991`, introduced in response to the ruling of Employment Div. v. Smith {cite}`1990employment` was an attempt by the Congress to bypass the rule of general applicability. 

Furthermore, in order to ratify an amendment, the super majorities requirements necessarily make “constitutional overruling vastly more difficult ({cite}`segal2002supreme`, 94)."  Only five amendments successfully rescinded Supreme Court decisions. 

Those are: 
1. The Eleventh Amendment ({cite}`USConst` ,Ammendment 11) overturned Chisholm v Georgia {cite}`Chisholm:1793`;  which enabled individuals to sue states in federal courts.
2. The Fourteenth Amendment ({cite}`USConst`, Ammendment 14) overturned Scott v. Sandford {cite}`Dred:1857`; which had declared blacks ineligible for United States citizenship.
3. The Sixteenth Amendment ({cite}`USConst`, Ammendment 16) overturned Pollock v. Farmer’s Loan and Trust Company {cite}`Pollock:1895`; which voided the federal income tax.
4. The Nineteenth Amendment ({cite}`USConst`, Ammendment 19) overruled Minor v. Happersett {cite}`Minor:1875`; which prohibited the Fourteenth Amendment from permitting women’s suffrage.
5. The Twenty-sixth Amendment ({cite}`USConst`, Ammendment 26) overturned Oregon v. Mitchell {cite}`Oregon:1970`; which had disallowed eighteen-year-olds from voting in state elections.  




### The President Can Not Influence The Court





Presidential influence too appears to be of little importance.  The most striking example is that of United States v. Nixon in which three Nixon appointees joined a unanimous decision forcing the President to turn over the Watergate tapes.  In effect, delivering the knockout punch, which required Nixon to resign himself from the presidency {cite}`USvNixon:1974`.



### The Superior Court is a Sovereign Court





As the court of last resort, The Supreme Court in no way must comply with the decisions of the lower courts, or obviously any superior court.  The result of which enables a level of discretion not apparent in the other branches of government, nor in the lower judiciary {cite}`songer1990overview`, {cite}`benesh2002us`.  In fact, non-compliant behavior among the lower courts is rare.  Even in the case of non-adherence to precedent by lower court judges, the Supreme Court often affirms the judgement as to reinforce its position at the apex of the judiciary {cite}`reddick2000norm`



### Certiorari Is an Example of Political Will





(posner-1999)=
#### Posner 1999

Because of the ability of the Supreme Court to control its own docket, justices are expected to vote in order to grant cert (or not) according their personal policy preferences.  Cases regarding an ambiguous constitutional question act as the perfect tool to accomplish these ends.  To quote Judge Richard Posner, “where the constitution is unclear, judicial review is likely to be guided by the political prejudices and the policy preferences of the of the judges rather than by the Constitution itself ({cite}`posner1999appeal`, 36-40)."

 

(schubert)=
## Justices Create Law According to their Ideological Preferences






The Judicial Mind {cite}`schubert1965judicial` and The Judicial Mind Revisited {cite}`schubert1974judicial` provided the first working attitudinal model of Supreme Court decision making.  He describes Judicial decision making as dependent upon ideological preferences and the context of facts of the case. 



(schubert-case-study)=
### Example





Consider the following cases:

1. The police search an apartment in which they have probable cause to enter.  While investigating the unit an officer eyes expensive stereo equipment.  He believes this to be stolen property, therefore he moves the equipment in order to obtain the serial numbers.  He later calls this information in, acquires a warrant, and seizes the equipment. {cite}`arizonahicks`

2. A man who had been observed by police officers to be transporting cocaine in his vehicle.  Two months after being observed, the man is arrested at his place of work for an unrelated charge.  The officers aware that the car had been used to carry contraband, seized it, claiming that they had probable cause to do so without a warrant. {cite}`floridawhite`
 
If we were to score these circumstance across ideological space we would find that the facts of the second case would lay to the left of the first.  For instance, the less prior justification and the more intrusive the search (home vs. car) the further to the right in ideological space.  The points along the line where t1. Political Science can ultimately become a science capable of prediction and explanation.
2. Political science should concern itself primarily, if not exclusively, with phenomena which can actually be observed. 
3. Data should be quantified and “findings” based upon quantifiable data.
4. Research should be theory oriented and theory directedhe cases lie we call j-points.

Next, we score the ideological values of the Individual justices.  For the sake of explaining the model, I choose the hypothetical justices A, B, and C.  A is so liberal that he does not believe any evidence should be seized without a warrant.  B, lies in the middle.  His ideological preferences would allow for the seizure of evidence without warrant only when officers have probable cause and are not searching one’s home.  Justice C lies to the Far right.  She will support any seizure of evidence so long as the officers do not physically harm the suspect.  These points are to be referred to as i-points (ideal points).  

Schubert posits that a justice will accept any set of action to the left of his ideal and then disregard all to the right. Or in other words, a justice will only accept a set of actions bounded by a maximum level of intrusiveness.  Action that falls beyond that set are morally unacceptable.  Therefore, a justice if true to his own ideological preferences will not vote to affirm an action to the right of his own ideological values.



### Judicial Attitudes and the facts of the case 



(spaeth)=
#### Harold Spaeth
Harold Spaeth expands upon the influence of attitudes on judical behavior. He defines his core idea, the attitude, as a relatively enduring “interrelated set of beliefs about an object or situation.  For social action to occur, at least two interacting attitudes, one concerning the attitude object and the other concerning the attitude situation must occur ({cite}`spaeth1972introduction`, 65)."  Objects are considered the “direct and indirect parties to the suit; situations are the dominant legal issue in the case ({cite}`segal2002supreme`, 91)."


(spaeth-and-peterson-1971)= 
#### Spaeth and Peterson 1971
In practice, Spaeth and Peterson organize the Court’s decisions into individual sets of cases on basis of the “attitude situation.”  “Attitude objects” then interact with “attitude situations.”  The theory assumes that sets of these cases that form around similar objects and situations will correlate with one another to form issue areas (e.g., criminal procedure, First Amendment freedoms, judicial power, federalism) in which an interrelated set of attitudes – that is, a value – will explain the justices’ behavior (eg. Freedom, equality, national supremacy, libertarianism) {cite}`spaeth1971analysis`


#### Goals

(rohde-and-spaeth)=
##### Rohde and Spaeth 1976

Building onto this psychological model, David Rhode and Harold Spaethe provide the explanation the structural systems which permits Justices to engage in attitudinal behavior. Influenced by the application of rational choice theory to politics they bounded attitudinal behavior to goals, rules, and situations.


Goals, to Rohde and Spaeth mean that “actors in political situations are outcome oriented; when they choose among a number of alternatives, they pick the alternative that they perceive will yield them the greatest net benefit in terms of their goals {cite}`rohde1976supreme`

The primary goals of Supreme Court justices in the decision-making process are policy goals.  Each member of the Court has preferences concerning the policy questions faced by the Court, and when the justices make decisions they want the outcomes to approximate as nearly as possible those policy preferences ({cite}`rohde1976supreme`, 72)."

In order for the justices to acquire their goals they must play by the rules of the game, “the various formal and informal rules and norms within the framework of which decisions are made.   As such, they specify which types of actions are permissible and which are impermissible, the circumstances and conditions under which choice may be exercised, and the manner of choosing ({cite}`rohde1976supreme`, 71)."



## Limitations of the Attitudinal Model






While the court enjoys a great amount of leeway in their decision-making process, this is by no means unrestrained.  “Situations” apply in which the vote on certiorari, formation of the majority opinion, opinion assignment, and so on bound the range of possible Judicial decisions.  Therefore, attitudes and values alone cannot account for the all factors guiding a justice’s process of decision making.  Rather, they serve as the guiding principles that allow for a justice to rationally navigate the rules and situations facing the court.  Thus, the open-ended model permitting limitless discretion cannot be wholly accurate. A pure attitudinal model may explain voting on the merits, but does not address the problem of opinion formation.  


Glendon Shubert addressed the problem.  He posits that justices’ vote for certiorari depends upon their predictions to what will happen according to the merit {cite}`schubert1960quantitative`.  Rhode and Spaeth as well examine the likelihood of the formation of “minimum winning opinion coalitions” when the court is facing threatening situations {cite}`rohde1976supreme`. Most importantly Maltzman, Spriggs, and Wahlbeck argue that the in order to solve the paradigm political scientists must move away from the attitudinal model ({cite}`maltzman2000crafting`, 4).
