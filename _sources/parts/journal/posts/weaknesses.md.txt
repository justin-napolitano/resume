# Identifying My Weaknesses

## Creating a CV

Writing a cv in an honest way is frightening.  It requires one to confront their professional identity directly. Doing so, has left me painfully aware of the fact that I have much to learn.  

### Data Science and ML

Prior to writing the cv I thought that I had a solid understanding of the field.  I know now that I need to study in depth the mathematics and the applications used to drive ml models.  I can hack together a TensorFlow project, but actually explaining my results is more difficult than I thought it would be.

### Database

I can query a SQL database, but I don't have experience in developing enterprise scale systems.  For instance, in one interview I was requested to design a third normal database.  While, I eventually hobbled an answer together, I found myself stumped by a simple question that would have been easy to anyone that had taken an introductory database course.  I on the other hand, had studied database design on the job and had not learned the theory, nor the standard diction that would have enabled me to communicate effectively to my team of interviewers.  

### Programming

I love to program, that however does not make me a software engineer.  Python, my language of choice is a great tool for analysis and wrapping services into pipeline, but I find that I am not an expert on the data structures and algorithms that computer scientists study. I have implemented most of these in C and Python, but I struggle to recall them from memory. Hence, the large reference section.  

### Statistical Analysis

Most of my work has only required exploratory analytics.  In depth analysis and hypothesis testing, which I have studied and completed in SAS, are still somewhat abstract to me.  It is a skillset that I in theory know, but must further develop and apply.
