# Analysis of the Legal Model of Jurisprudence

## Introduction

:::{card}

The definnition of the legal model varies by theorist.  The central premise however is that the “decisions of the Court are substantially influenced by the facts of the case in light of the plain meaning of statutes and the Constitution, the intent of the Framers, and/or precedent {cite}`segal2002supreme`.

The validity of the model is disputed amongst jurists, legal scholars, and political scientists.

## Jurists and the Legal Model





Justices Scalia, Hugo Black, Rehnquist and Thomas are notable proponents of the legal model. 

Justice Scalia, claims that he “treats the Constitution like a statute, giving the Constitution the meaning that its words were understood to bear at the time they were promulgated {cite}`scalia2003judicial`. Precedent, and general rules in his mind must be the source of law, with the Supreme law being the Constitution {cite}`scalia2003judicial`.  General rules devoid of “textual anchor” or at the least an “established social norm” to Justice Scalia and proponents of the Legal mode appear “uncomfortably like legislation {cite}`scalia2003judicial`."   


Hugo Black, according to Davis, “followed the plain meaning of the words and the intent of the framers ({cite}`davis2014justice` , 23-24)"; and “with a near religious fervor for most of his tenure on the Court, fought and argued to base his and the Court’s constitutional interpretation on the literal text itself ({cite}`ball1992power`, 318-319)."  Justice Black’s jurisprudence can be said to have been interpreted “in accordance with the intent of the Framers and the history of the clause or amendment ({cite}`ball1992power`, 318-319)."

Like, the liberal Justice Black,  Justice Rehnquist also claimed to base his behavior upon precedent and text.  Davis states, that Rehnquist’s jurisprudence cannot be explained by his conservative ideology, but by legal philosophy.  He was first and foremost a legal positivist, who believed that “lawmaking is a prerogative of legislators rather than judges… In an attempt to adhere to the law as an empirical fact, a positivist jurist limits his or her interpretation of the Constitution to the meaning of the words or text or intent of its authors ({cite}`davis2014justice` , 24)."  

Among the current members of the Bench, Justice Thomas “seeks to base his opinions on the original intent of the Framers of the Constitutions, Bill of Rights, and subsequent constitutional amendments ({cite}`smith1997clarence`, 9). The support for his opinions (and dissents for that matter) reference the primacy of the Founder’s intentions which to him dictate the outcome of cases.

### Dworkin and the Legal Model




Political theorists like Ronald Dworkin, in Taking Rights Seriously {cite}`dworkin2013taking` argues that jhustices do not freely exercise discretion according to ideological preference alone.  Instead, he posits that precedent guides justices towards a decision.  In contrast to attitudinal theorists he does not accept that Justices merely pick and choose from precedent in order to rationalize their individual values.  The law determined by precedent is considered to the rule which Justices follow.

In fact, precedent is considered to be the paramount authority in cases in which no preexisting rule of law exists ({cite}`dworkin2013taking` , 110 -115). Dworkin, denies that in such cases judges essentially legislate new rights, and fervently “denies that they exercise discretion ({cite}`dworkin2013taking` , 49).”  Along with the Justice Scalia, he claims, that it is a “judge’s duty, even in hard cases, to discover what the rights of the parties are, not to invent new rights retrospectively ({cite}`dworkin2013taking` , 81.”  Instead when the facts of a new case fall within the matrix of rules developed by precedent, the earlier cases exert an “enactment force” which restricts the range of judicial discretion.  Even when unprecedented cases reach the bench, earlier decisions exert a “gravitational force” again limiting judicial decision making ({cite}`dworkin2013taking` , 111).  These two combined forces do not allow for a justice to merely make the law according to their preferences.  Instead, they must balance his own “intellectual and philosophical convictions” with the facts of the case and precedent ({cite}`dworkin2013taking` , 118).  In doing so a justice will find the correct legal answer tempered by personal experience and philosophy.  

Dworkin’s work does not argue that the subjective factor of jurisprudence is totally eliminated.   Rather, the justice is argued to operate as a qualified filter that selects the proper ruling in a case while bound by the structures of legal history and precedent.   Accordingly this theoretical approach nullifies certain interpretations from a possible win set available to a justice.  The Judge’s job then is to find the law with the support of a “textual anchor” or “extant legislation.”  Individual interpretations, or bounds may different, but nonetheless precedent affects decision making.  Dworkin also considers the role of institutional factors.  Higher courts, he acknowledges, are not obligated to strictly follow precedent due to their position within the hierarchy of the courts, but are to a degree still reliant upon the pull of precedent.  {cite}`dworkin2013taking`



### Kahn and the legal model.  



Of the theorists and justices arguing for a legal model, Khan's argument is most succint.  He states, that:

* "Members of the Supreme Court believe that they are required to act in accordance with particular institutional and legal expectations and responsibilities ({cite}`kahn1999institutional`, 175);"
* "The Court does not follow elections or politics, but views itself as autonomous from direct and indirect political pressures ({cite}`kahn1999institutional`, 177);"
* “Justices do not follow personal policy wants ({cite}`kahn1999institutional`, 177);” 
* “respect for precedent and principled decision making are central to decision making ({cite}`kahn1999institutional`, 177)."


## Limitations of the Legal Model



In order for a legal model to be accurate a justice themself must accept the model to be legitimate.  Or in other words, justices must accept as precedent, plain meaning, and textual sources to be the proverbial word of god.  They must then hedge themselves into artificial boxes created by the framers and previous justices without considering their personal policy preferences or individual biases.  

I find this argument difficult to accept as valid.  I would argue that pecedent, intent, and gobblygook are but rationalizations that justices create to justify their own preferences.  The court, like every other institution is political.  This is true whether justices or idealists are willing to admit it to themselves.
