Sales Reporting CLI Program
============================

Description
--------------
* A CLI tool written in python that is designed to imitate dos-ibm systems.
* The program stores common reports that can be selected via a decision tree.
* The program was written as a proof of concept that the management team could use a familiar interface to replace multiple sql specialists that simply wrote stored proceudres. 

How to Improve
------------------
* Rewrite into a functional paradigm.
* Rewrite into multiple services.
* Ensure the scope of the project is understood as best as possible before writing any code.
* Store sql scripts external to the program itself.
* Use YAML to manage jobs and eliminate the user driven configuration interface.
